## Project Description

### Goal:

- An interactive and animative portfolio website to display web development, programming, and designing skills to potential employers.

### Theme:

- Minimalist vibe overall and dark mode but wanted it to be reinvented from scratch compared to the midterm project and to be more interactive, dynamic and fun to navigate through unlike the midterm's static website.

### Pages:

- Home Page (introductory page on general skills, interests, etc)
- Projects Page (collection of projects and can be clicked to learn more about it)
- Gallery Page (collection of photography)
- About Page (biography page about more specific information)
- Contact Form (popup modal)

## Other features

- Light mode on smaller screens
- Go to top arrow on every page
- Interactive quiz on About Page

## Skills/Libraries Used

- There are several GSAP animations used throughout the website
- JS, HTML, CSS general skills
- Bootstrap v5

## Notes:

- For Mobile version, optimum sizing is at 768px. The website will be in light mode instead of dark mode to indicate it's in the mobile media query.
